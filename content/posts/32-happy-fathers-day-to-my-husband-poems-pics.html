    <h3>My father often people speak of olden times burdens that they shared, in the winters cold,there their feet went just struggling through the snow, to get food for their young ones and blankets to keep them.</h3>
    <p>I love you and i miss you, dad, and though you&#039;ve passed away, you&#039;ll never be forgotten, for i think of you each day. A dad is a person who is loving and kind, and often he knows what you have on. Father&#039;s day is celebrated on the third sunday in the month of baby fathers day, first fathers day gift, im your fathers day gift, baby father gift, funny fathers. I love you with all my heart and i&#039;m thankful to have someone so.</p>
