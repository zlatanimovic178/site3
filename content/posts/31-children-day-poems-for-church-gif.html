                Funny rhyming poems about santa claus and presents. Read all poems on church. This beloved poem was first printed in the night before christmas and other popular stories for children, a beautiful illustrated children&#039;s book published.
    </p>

    <h3>Christmas is forever, not for just one day, for loving, sharing, giving, are not to put away like bells and lights and tinsel, in i&#039;m dreaming of a white christmas, just like the ones i used to know, where the treetops glisten and children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow.</h3>
    <p>Each christmas finds me longing for christmases now past, and i am back in childhood as long as memories last. By his death, his children he did save. But to remind the adults to dry their tears. Mothers day prayers (poems) will bless your mom on mothers day.</p>
