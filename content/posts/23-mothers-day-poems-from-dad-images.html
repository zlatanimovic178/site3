                This mother&#039;s day greeting is coming to convey the heartfelt thanks so mom where would i be without you as even now dad still can&#039;t cook; The first of the funny mothers day poems on this page is illustrated with a drawing inspired by a photo of me and my two boys (who are now both fathers themselves!). Old women say that men don&#039;t know the pain through which all mothers go, and maybe that is true, and yet i vow i never shall forget.
    </p>

    <p>After all these emotional wording you need to give a smile on your mom&#039;s face which is easily possible by giving her a handmade colorful greeting card with a funny joke or funny poem. This is a wonderful poem dedicated to your mother. Our fathers carry half of our genetic makeup. Mothers day verses poems quotes © v4c.</p>
